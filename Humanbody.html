                        <h2>Skeletal System</h2>
                        <p>The skeletal system is the framework of the human body, providing structural support and protection for internal organs. Composed of bones, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons, it consists of over 200 individual bones. The axial skeleton, including the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage, supports the body's axis, while the appendicular skeleton, comprising the bones of the limbs and girdles, facilitates movement. Bones are living tissues that undergo constant remodeling, influenced by factors such as diet, exercise, and hormonal regulation. The skeletal system also houses bone marrow, responsible for the production of blood cells through hematopoiesis.</p>

                        <h2>Muscular System</h2>
                        <p>The muscular system enables movement, stability, and posture through the contraction and relaxation of muscles. Consisting of over 600 muscles, it is divided into three types: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. Skeletal muscles, attached to bones via tendons, are under voluntary control and responsible for locomotion and manipulation. Smooth muscles, found in internal organs such as the intestines and blood vessels, perform involuntary movements to regulate organ function. Cardiac muscles, exclusive to the heart, contract rhythmically to pump blood throughout the body. Muscles work in coordination with the skeletal system to produce coordinated movements around joints.</p>

                        <h2>Cardiovascular System</h2>
                        <p>The cardiovascular system, also known as the circulatory system, transports blood, nutrients, oxygen, and waste products throughout the body. It comprises the heart, blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries), and blood. The heart pumps oxygenated blood to tissues via arteries and returns deoxygenated blood to the lungs for reoxygenation via veins. Capillaries facilitate the exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products between blood and tissues. The cardiovascular system plays a vital role in regulating blood pressure, maintaining fluid balance, and supporting immune function.</p>

                        <h2>Digestive System</h2>
                        <p>The digestive system processes food, extracts nutrients, and eliminates waste products from the body. It includes the gastrointestinal tract (mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine) and accessory organs (liver, gallbladder, pancreas). Digestion begins in the mouth with mechanical and chemical breakdown of food, continues in the stomach and small intestine where nutrients are absorbed, and ends in the large intestine where water and electrolytes are absorbed, and waste is formed into feces for elimination. The digestive system also houses a complex microbiome that aids in digestion and immune function.</p>

                <div class="text">
				<h2>Endocrine System</h2>
                <p>The endocrine system regulates various physiological processes through the production and secretion of hormones. It includes glands such as the pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, ovaries, and testes, as well as hormone-secreting tissues in organs like the kidneys and heart. Hormones act as chemical messengers, influencing metabolism, growth and development, reproduction, stress response, and energy balance. The endocrine system plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis, coordinating responses to internal and external stimuli, and supporting overall health and well-being.</p>

				<div class="text">
                <h2>Nervous System</h2>
                <p>The nervous system is the body's communication network, transmitting signals between cells, tissues, and organs to coordinate bodily functions. It consists of the central nervous system (CNS), comprising the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), including nerves and ganglia outside the CNS. The nervous system regulates voluntary actions through the somatic nervous system and involuntary actions through the autonomic nervous system. Neurons, the fundamental units of the nervous system, transmit electrical impulses across synapses, facilitating sensory perception, motor control, and cognitive processes such as memory and learning.</p>

                <div class="text">
				<h2>Respiratory System</h2>
                <p>The respiratory system facilitates the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the body and the environment. It includes the upper respiratory tract (nose, nasal cavity, pharynx) and lower respiratory tract (larynx, trachea, bronchi, lungs). During inhalation, air enters the respiratory system and travels through the airways to the alveoli, where gas exchange occurs. Oxygen diffuses into the bloodstream, while carbon dioxide moves from the bloodstream into the alveoli to be exhaled. The respiratory system also plays a role in regulating blood pH and vocalization.</p>

				<h2>Immune/Lymphatic System</h2>
                <p>The immune system protects the body from pathogens, foreign substances, and abnormal cells. It includes a network of organs, tissues, and cells that work together to defend against infections and diseases. Key components of the immune system include lymphocytes (such as B cells and T cells), lymphoid organs (like the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes), and lymphatic vessels. The lymphatic system aids in immune function by transporting lymph, a fluid containing white blood cells and waste products, throughout the body. Together, the immune and lymphatic systems play crucial roles in maintaining overall health and combating illness.</p>

                <div class="text">
				<h2>Urinary System</h2>
                <p>The urinary system, also known as the renal system, is responsible for filtering blood, removing waste products, and regulating fluid balance in the body. It consists of the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. The kidneys filter blood to remove waste products and excess substances, producing urine, which is then transported to the bladder for storage and eventual elimination through the urethra. In addition to waste removal, the urinary system helps regulate electrolyte levels, blood pressure, and acid-base balance.</p>

                <img src="female-reproductive-system.jpg" alt="Female Reproductive System">
				<div class="text">
                <h2>Female Reproductive System</h2>
                <p>The female reproductive system is responsible for producing and nurturing offspring. Key organs include the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, and external genitalia. The ovaries produce eggs (ova) and secrete female sex hormones such as estrogen and progesterone. During the menstrual cycle, an egg is released from the ovary and travels through the fallopian tube, where it may be fertilized by sperm. If fertilization occurs, the fertilized egg implants in the uterus, where it develops into a fetus during pregnancy. The female reproductive system also plays a role in sexual intercourse and childbirth.</p>

                <div class="text">
				<h2>Male Reproductive System</h2>
                <p>The male reproductive system is responsible for producing and delivering sperm for fertilization. Key organs include the testes, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and penis. The testes produce sperm and secrete male sex hormones such as testosterone. Sperm mature and are stored in the epididymis before being transported through the vas deferens during ejaculation. Seminal fluid, produced by accessory glands like the seminal vesicles and prostate gland, nourishes and transports sperm during ejaculation. The male reproductive system also plays a role in sexual intercourse and the fertilization of eggs.</p>

                <div class="text">
				<h2>Integumentary System</h2>
                <p>The integumentary system is the body's largest organ system, consisting of the skin, hair, nails, and associated glands. It serves several important functions, including protection against physical injury, pathogens, and UV radiation; regulation of body temperature; sensation of touch, pressure, and temperature; synthesis of vitamin D; and excretion of waste products through sweat glands. The skin consists of three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. Hair and nails are derivatives of the skin, composed of keratinized cells. Glands such as sebaceous glands and sweat glands secrete oils and sweat to lubricate and protect the skin.</p>
